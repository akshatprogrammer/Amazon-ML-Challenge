Amazon ML Challenge is a two-stage competition where students from all engineering campuses across India will get a unique opportunity to work on Amazon’s dataset to bring in fresh ideas and build innovative solutions for a real-world problem statement. The top three winning teams will receive pre-placement interviews (PPIs) for ML roles at Amazon along with cash prizes and certificates.

## Problem
Amazon catalog consists of billions of products that belong to thousands of browse nodes (each browse node represents a collection of items for sale). Browse nodes are used to help customer navigate through our website and classify products to product type groups. Hence, it is important to predict the node assignment at the time of listing of the product or when the browse node information is absent.

As part of this hackathon, you will use product metadata to classify products into browse nodes. You will have access to product title, description, bullet points etc. and labels for ~3MM products to train and test your submissions. Note that there is some noise in the data - real world data looks like this!!
